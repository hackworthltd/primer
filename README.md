# Primer

Primer is a pedagogical functional programming language. This
repository contains Haskell implementations of:

* the core language;
* a database adapter for storing Primer programs; and
* a web service.

Note that Primer must be built with GHC 9.2.1 or later.

# Developing Primer

We use [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to develop Primer,
so all of the documentation that follows assumes you've got a working
Nix installation with flakes support enabled. Our flake supports both
`x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-darwin` systems.

Our implementation of Primer stores programs in a SQL database. We
currently support two SQL backend implementations: SQLite and
PostgreSQL.

## Local development with SQLite

Developing Primer with a local SQLite database is straightforward, so
long as you have a working Nix flakes setup. Just run the following
command:

```sh
nix run .#run-primer-sqlite
```

By default, this command will:

1. Deploy a SQLite database named `primer.sqlite3` in the current
   working directory. It will create a new empty database if one
   doesn't already exist.
2. Run `primer-service` on your host machine and configure it to
   listen on TCP port `8081` on all network interfaces.

This command uses the same script to launch the service as our Docker
container uses, and therefore it takes no command-line arguments.
Instead, you can override the defaults by setting any of the following
environment variables (shown along with their default values):

| Environment variable   |      Purpose                                          |  Default         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| SQLITE_DB              | Filesystem path to the SQLite database                | `primer.sqlite3` |
| SERVICE_PORT           | TCP port on which the service listens for connections | `8081`           |

Note that the script will actually create *two* database files: one
named `primer.sqlite3`, and the other named `sqitch.sqlite3`. The
latter contains metadata required by
[Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitchtutorial-sqlite/), which
we use to manage database schemas.

If you want to start over with a new database, either set `SQLITE_DB`
to a new path, or remove both the `primer.sqlite3` and
`sqitch.sqlite3` database files.

If you don't want to use the `run-primer-sqlite` command for some
reason, you can also run `primer-service` directly via a Nix flake
app. For usage, run:

```sh
nix run .#primer-service serve -- --help
```

## Local development with PostgreSQL

Developing Primer with a PostgreSQL database backend is much more
involved than with SQLite, but we do provide some Nix tooling to make
it a bit easier.

### Initial setup

The first time you want to do local Primer development on a particular
system, you'll need to run the following commands from the top-level
directory in this repo:

```sh
nix run .#deploy-postgresql-container
nix run .#create-local-db
```

This sequence of commands will use
[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) to do the following:

1. Create a new Colima profile named `primer`.
2. Run a PostgreSQL container in the `primer` profile, using Colima's
   Docker-compatible runtime. The PostgreSQL service running on the
   container listens on the default PostgreSQL TCP port, `5432`.
3. Create a PostgreSQL database named `primer`.

In general, you should only need to run that sequence the first time
you do any Primer development on a new development machine, or if you
want to start over with a completely new PostgreSQL container for some
reason. The container & database those commands create will persist
across reboots, and will remain on your system until you delete them.
However, it's safe to run these commands multiple times, and only a
single PostgreSQL instance and `primer` database will exist at any
given time.

### Development workflow

Your usual Primer development workflow will look something like this:

```sh
nix run .#run-primer-postgresql
```

By default, this command will:

1. Deploy the Primer database schema to the default local PostgreSQL
   instance.
2. Run `primer-service` on your host machine and configure it to
   listen on TCP port `8081` on all network interfaces.

This command uses the same script to launch the service as our Docker
container uses, and therefore it takes no command-line arguments.
Instead, you can override the defaults by setting any of the following
environment variables (shown along with their default values):

| Environment variable   |      Purpose                                          |  Default         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| DATABASE_URL           | The PostgreSQL-style URI of the database              | `postgres://postgres:primer-dev@localhost:5432/primer`` |
| SERVICE_PORT           | TCP port on which the service listens for connections | `8081`                                                  |

Note that you'll also need to run the `start-postgresql-container`
command if the `primer-postgres` container is not already running.
Typically, this will only happen after a reboot, or if you've manually
stopped the container. To determine whether the container is running,
use this command from the project's Nix shell:

```sh
docker --context colima-primer ps
```

If it's running, you should see something like this:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
a818e6d5f3ef   postgres:13.4-alpine3.14   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   29 hours ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp   postgres-primer
```

If it's not, then perform the following steps:

```sh
colima start --runtime docker --profile primer
nix run .#start-postgresql-container
```

The details of each PostgreSQL helper script in this repo follow:

### `deploy-postgresql-container`

This script does the following:

* Uses [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) to configure a
  Docker-compatible Linux container runtime on your system.
* Downloads the official PostgreSQL Docker image for the version of
  PostgreSQL that we support.
* Creates a persistent Docker volume named `postgres-primer` to ensure
  the database is preserved across container restarts and upgrades.
* Creates a Docker container that runs PostgreSQL and listens on
  `localhost:5432`.

Note that you do *not* need to install or run Docker in order to use
this or any other script in this repo, as Colima provides the required
container functionality. The scripts do use the `docker` command-line
utility, but only to manage the container, images, and persistent
volumes.

If you're already running Docker, Colima works alongside it without
conflict. The scripts in this repo will run all containers in a
separate `colima-primer` Docker context, in order to keep the Primer
development environment from affecting any other Docker contexts you
may be using.

### `start-postgresql-container`

This script starts the `primer-postgres` container, assuming that it's
previously been deployed by the `deploy-postgresql-container` command.
The container will keep running until you reboot your host machine, or
you stop the container yourself.

### `stop-postgresql-container`

This script stops the `primer-postgres` container.

### `create-local-db`

This script creates the `primer` database in the local PostgreSQL
instance. This database must have been created before Primer can
connect to it.

### `deploy-local-db`

This script ensures your local database is using the latest schema.
You'll need to run it anytime there's a schema change. We'll do our
best to broadcast when this is necessary.

Note that this script is safe to run at any time, even if the database
is already using the latest schema.

### Other helper scripts

* `delete-local-db` drops the Primer database from the local
  PostgreSQL instance. **Warning**: this script will delete all of the
  Primer programs in your local database.

* `dump-local-db` dumps the Primer database from the local PostgreSQL
  instance. It's mainly useful in combination with the
  `restore-local-db` script.

* `restore-local-db` restores a Primer database dump by dropping the
  existing Primer database (**warning**: the existing database
  contents will not be saved!), creating a fresh, empty Primer
  database, and then loading the dump into the new database. This
  script is most useful in combination with the `dump-local-db`
  script.

* `verify-local-db` reports the differences between the latest schema
  and the schema your local database is using.

* `revert-local-db` reverts the local database to a previous schema.
  Note that this may not always be successful. You should generally
  only need to run this command if you're testing database schema
  migrations. You can specify which git commit to revert to by passing
  the following flags: `-- --to <rev>`. For example, to revert any
  changes made since `HEAD`:

```sh
nix run .#revert-local-db -- --to @HEAD
```

## `make` targets

We use `Makefile`s for convenient local development commands. These
`make` targets assume you're in the `nix develop` shell:

* `make` runs `cabal build` across all projects.

* `make test` runs `cabal test` across all projects.

* `make bench` runs `cabal bench` across all projects.

We do not provide `make` targets for running the service locally, and
instead recommend that you use either `nix run .#run-primer-sqlite` or
`nix run .#run-primer-postgresql` as described elsewhere in this
documentation.

# Database ops

We use [Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/about/) to manage our database
schemas, both for PostgreSQL and SQLite. Because these database
engines are quite different, we require separate schemas for each.

Most of what you need to know to use `sqitch` with Primer is included
in this section, but for general help on how to use `sqitch` and a bit
about how it works, see [the `sqitch` PostgreSQL
tutorial](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitchtutorial/).

Note: we do not use Sqitch for any PostgreSQL user or group
permissions, nor any database-wide security settings in general. The
reason for this is because we assume that for some
PostgreSQL-compatible cloud database offerings, user provisioning and
security settings may be managed out of band using the cloud
provider's own APIs. Therefore, our Sqitch scripts assume that the
PostgreSQL user who's running the scripts has all the permissions
required to perform any operations included in those scripts, and that
a [secure schema usage
pattern](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PATTERNS)
has been configured out-of-band.


## Sqitch setup

Before running any `sqitch` commands, you need to configure it with
your name and email address. Note that you need only do this once per
machine where you run `sqitch`:

```sh
sqitch config --user user.name "Your Name"
sqitch config --user user.email your-email-address@hackworthltd.com
```

## Schema changes

Making schema changes to the Primer Sqitch configuration is out of
scope for this document. See the [Sqitch documentation for multiple
engines](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-configuration/#separate-plans)
and note that we use the "separate plans" approach described therein.
Any Sqitch commands that modify the schema should be run in the
`sqitch` subdirectory of this repo.

## A note about the Sqitch scripts

We provide a few Sqitch scripts for common Sqitch operations, in
addition to a `primer-sqitch` wrapper script that bundles a copy of
the project's Sqitch config. We recommend that you at least use the
`primer-sqitch` command rather than running raw `sqitch`. These
commands are available in the `nix develop` shell, and can be run as
Flake apps, as well; e.g., `nix run .#primer-sqitch ...`

However, one drawback of this approach is that if you're making local
changes to the Sqitch schema, you'll need to make sure that the
scripts in your Nix shell incorporate your changes. This won't happen
automatically in most cases, so either you'll need to exit and
re-enter the Nix shell via `nix develop`, or, if you're using `direnv`
with Nix flake support, you can just `touch flake.nix`.

# Generating an OpenAPI spec

We can automatically generate an OpenAPI spec for `primer-service`:

```sh
make openapi.json
```

This will place the generated spec in a file named `openapi.json`.
(Note: do not check this generated file into this repository.)

# Benchmarking

We run various benchmarks to track performance regressions. We try to
ensure that the benchmarks are run in a repeatable, quiescent
environment, but we may from time to time need to change the hardware
on which the benchmarks are run, which will inevitably cause
discontinuities in benchmark results. In the table below, we make a
best-effort attempt to track the commits to `main` after which
discontinuities may appear.

| Last commit                              | Subsequent change
