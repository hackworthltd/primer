# Foreword might not actually re-export _all_ operators from these modules,
# but this is a lot nicer than explicitly listing all of the ones that it does.
# For some reason they're not picked up with `module Foreword exports Protolude`.

  - module Foreword exports Control.Applicative
  - module Foreword exports Data.Function
