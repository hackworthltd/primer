## Not in spec

<*Describe any features that your implementation is explicitly avoiding, that a reasonable person might think should be in spec. For example, if you're adding a new action that operates on variables, but it only works with term variables and not type variables, you might want to mention it here so that the scope of the feature is clear.*>
