# Project overview

Our implementation of the Primer programming language is not like most
other programming language implementations. We don't provide a typical
command-line compiler, or `readline`-based REPL/interpreter, for
example.

## Programming language as a service

Instead, our implementation of the Primer programming language is
intended for use as a sort of Ã¼ber language server, but not in the
more familiar sense of the [Microsoft Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
(LSP). Unlike LSP servers, the Primer language server is the single
source of truth for a given Primer program. The Primer language server
provides the following services to its clients:

* It stores and retrieves programs from a program store, backed by a
  database engine. In our implementation of Primer, there's no concept
  of programs stored in flat text files in a hierarchical filesystem.

* It provides the program's abstract syntax tree (AST) to the client,
  along with a list of type-safe, atomic AST editing actions that can
  be performed at the currently-selected node, making it relatively
  easy to implement structure editors.

* It type checks the entire program, and can automatically fix up
  programs after editing actions are performed, guaranteeing that
  programs are always well-formed, modulo holes (which are similar in
  concept to GHC's [typed
  holes](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/exts/typed_holes.html?highlight=typed+holes),
  but implemented quite differently).

* It provides both a small-step reducible expression (*redex*)
  evaluator, for tracing program evaluation in learning and debugging
  contexts, and a "big-step" evaluator, for running programs to
  (bounded) termination.

In a nutshell, the Primer language server provides all of the
functionality that one needs to read, write, run, debug, and store
programs via a single, comprehensive API. Developers of Primer
programming environments can focus on writing fluid, cohesive UIs and
delivering a great user experience (UX), without getting bogged down
in gluing together a number of disparate tools, each parsing and
analyzing the same program over and over in inefficient, often brittle
ways.

In its current implementation, the Primer language server runs as a
native executable, typically in a containerized Linux environment, but
in the not-too-distant future, we expect to generate a JavaScript
and/or WebAssembly executable that can run most of these services
directly in the browser, eliminating the most expensive and least
scalable aspects of the backend service.

## Project organization

This Primer project is a collection of Haskell packages, which
together implement a Primer language service:

* `primer` implements the Primer language, including the type checker,
  the two evaluators, and an API that exposes these features to other
  Haskell programs.

* `primer-selda` implements [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database
  bindings for the Primer language server's program store.

(Additionally, the `primer-benchmark` package is used by the project
maintainers to track performance regressions and improvements, but
plays no part in the implementation of the Primer language service.)

The project also includes various tools for testing, linting, and
formatting code; and for managing the project's database schema. These
tools, and their related development workflows, are covered in detail
in other sections of this guide.
