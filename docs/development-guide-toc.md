# Primer development guide table of contents

## A note about the scope of this guide

The primary audience for this guide is anyone who'd like to build the
project for the purposes of testing it locally, making a code
contribution to the project, or generally just satisfying their
curiosity about how our implementation works.

Please note that this development guide does not cover the syntax,
semantics, or design of the Primer programming language; nor does it
describe the Haskell types, functions, etc., that comprise our
particular implementation of the language. The former will eventually
be published to a separate website, and the latter are available in
the various packages' Haddocks.
