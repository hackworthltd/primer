# Local development with PostgreSQL

Running the Primer API server locally with a PostgreSQL database
backend is much more involved than with [SQLite](developing.md), but
we do provide some Nix tooling to make it a bit easier.

Note that most of the PostgreSQL development tooling we provide
assumes you want to spin up a local development PostgreSQL server
that's dedicated to testing Primer, rather than using an existing
remote (or local) server. The tooling should be reasonably easy to
adapt to use any PostgreSQL server, but we don't have the resources to
support these development workflows, unfortunately.

## Initial setup

The first time you want to do local Primer development on a particular
host, you'll need to run the following commands from the top-level
directory in this repo:

```sh
nix run .#deploy-postgresql-container
nix run .#create-local-db
```

This sequence of commands will do the following:

1. Create a new [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) profile named `primer`.
2. Run a PostgreSQL container in the `primer` profile, using Colima's
   Docker-compatible runtime. The PostgreSQL service running on the
   container listens on the default PostgreSQL TCP port, `5432`.
3. Create a PostgreSQL database named `primer`.

In general, you should only need to run this sequence of commands the
first time you do any Primer development on a new development machine,
or if you want to start over with a completely new PostgreSQL
container for some reason. The container & database those commands
create will persist across reboots, and will remain on your system
until you delete them. However, it's safe to run these commands
multiple times, as they will create only a single container and
`primer` database.

## Development workflow

Your usual Primer development workflow will look something like this:

```sh
nix run .#run-primer-postgresql
```

By default, this command will:

1. Deploy the Primer database schema to the default local PostgreSQL
   instance.
2. Run `primer-service` on your host machine and configure it to
   listen on TCP port `8081` on all network interfaces.

This command uses the same script to launch the service as our
production Docker container uses, and therefore, in typical Docker
entrypoint style, it takes no command-line arguments. Instead, you can
override the server's default configuration by setting any of the
following environment variables (shown along with their default
values):

| Environment variable |      Purpose                                          |  Default                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`       | The PostgreSQL-style URI of the database              | `postgres://postgres:primer-dev@localhost:5432/primer` |
| `SERVICE_PORT`       | TCP port on which the service listens for connections | `8081`                                                 |

Note that you'll also need to run the `start-postgresql-container` Nix
flake app if the `primer-postgres` container is not already running;
see below for details. Typically, this will only happen after a
reboot, or if you've manually stopped the container. To determine
whether the container is running, use this command from the project's
Nix shell:

```sh
docker --context colima-primer ps
```

If it's running, you should see something like this:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
a818e6d5f3ef   postgres:13.4-alpine3.14   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   29 hours ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp   postgres-primer
```

If it's not, then perform the following steps from the project's `nix develop` shell:

```sh
colima start --runtime docker --profile primer
nix run .#start-postgresql-container
```

## PostgreSQL helper scripts

The following helper scripts are also available for the PostgreSQL
development workflow. These can be run in the `nix develop` shell, or
as Nix flake apps via `nix run`. Typically, you'll just need to run
the higher-level commands described above for a local development
workflow with PostgreSQL, but if you'd like a comprehensive
understanding of what those higher-level commands are doing under the
hood, read on.

### `deploy-postgresql-container`

This script does the following:

* Uses Colima to configure a Docker-compatible Linux container runtime
  on your system.
* Downloads the official PostgreSQL Docker image for the version of
  PostgreSQL that we support.
* Creates a persistent Docker volume named `postgres-primer` to ensure
  the database is preserved across container restarts and upgrades.
* Creates a Docker container that runs PostgreSQL and listens on
  `localhost:5432`.

Note that you do *not* need to install or run Docker in order to use
this or any other script in this repo, as Colima provides the required
container functionality. The scripts do use the `docker` command-line
utility, but only to manage the container, images, and persistent
volumes.

If you're already running Docker, Colima works alongside it without
conflict. The scripts in this repo will run all containers in a
separate `colima-primer` Docker context, in order to keep the Primer
development environment from affecting any other Docker contexts you
may be using.

### `start-postgresql-container`

This script starts the `primer-postgres` container, assuming that it's
previously been deployed by the `deploy-postgresql-container` command.
The container will keep running until you reboot your host machine, or
you stop the container yourself.

### `stop-postgresql-container`

This script stops the `primer-postgres` container.

### `create-local-db`

This script creates the `primer` database in the local PostgreSQL
instance. This database must have been created before Primer can
connect to it.

### `deploy-local-db`

This script ensures your local database is using the latest schema.
You'll need to run it anytime there's a schema change. We'll do our
best to broadcast when this is necessary.

Note that this script is safe to run at any time, even if the database
is already using the latest schema.

## Other helper scripts

You'll probably use these additional scripts less often than the
others, but they're available if you need them:

* `delete-local-db` drops the Primer database from the local
  PostgreSQL instance. **Warning**: this script will delete all of the
  Primer programs in your local database.

* `dump-local-db` dumps the Primer database from the local PostgreSQL
  instance. It's mainly useful in combination with the
  `restore-local-db` script.

* `restore-local-db` restores a Primer database dump by dropping the
  existing Primer database (**warning**: the existing database
  contents will not be saved!), creating a fresh, empty Primer
  database, and then loading the dump into the new database. This
  script is most useful in combination with the `dump-local-db`
  script.

* `verify-local-db` reports the differences between the latest schema
  and the schema your local database is using.

* `revert-local-db` reverts the local database to a previous schema.
  Note that this may not always be successful. You should generally
  only need to run this command if you're testing database schema
  migrations. You can specify which git commit to revert to by passing
  the following flags: `-- --to <rev>`. For example, to revert any
  changes made since `HEAD`, run `nix run .#revert-local-db -- --to @HEAD`.
