Changes in 1.10
  * Add support for quasi-quotes, as the preferred way of dealing
    with non-properly showable things.

Changes in 1.9.5
  * Add a `PrettyVal` instance for `Data.Fixed`

Changes in 1.9.4
  * Fix issue #35

Changes in 1.9.3
  * Fix issue #34

Changes in 1.9.2
  * Allow VARSYM as infix constructors

Changes in 1.9.1
  * Allow keywords as the name of constructors

Changes in 1.9
  * Add support for pre-processing values before printing.
    In particular, we add a pre-processor which will hide some constructors
    from the output.

Changes in 1.8.2
  * Switch to using version 3.3.1 of jquery (jquery 1 seems to be long gone)

Changes in 1.8
  * Rejigger the rendering of unusal values, to improve the rendering of datres.
    - a sequence of values with negative numbers is turned into an infix con
    - change the association when sequences meet infix things

Changes in 1.7
  * Add a dependency on package Text
    - Adds an instance for `PrettyVal Text`
    - Paves the road for using `Text` in the representation of values.

Changes in 1.6.16
  * Fixes to accomodate GHC 8.4

Changes in 1.6.13
  * Parse things like <function> and <Function> as constructors

Changes in 1.6.12
  * Treat reserved operators as infix constructors (best effort kind of thing)

Changes in 1.6.11
  * Add `pPrint`, which is `putStrLn . ppShow`

Changes in 1.6.10
  * Increase the precedence of unary minus

Changes in 1.6.9
  * Relax parsing of atoms, so that we can support things like the show
    instance of StdGen (e.g., [ 123 45, 786 10 ])

Changes in 1.6.8.2:
  * Correct license in srouce files.

Changes in 1.6.8.1:
  * Correct the 'License' field in the Cabal file to match the license (MIT)

Changes in 1.6.8:
  * Move source-repository pragma to top-level.

Changes in 1.6.5:
  * Rename CHANGES to CHANGELOG to work with hackage.

Changes in 1.6.4:
  * Drop dependency on happy >= 1.19

Changes in 1.6.3:
  * Add Safe Haskell annotations
  * Add CHANGES file
  * Add generated parser to package again.  We do this, because otherwise
    the package fails to build on systems that do not have `happy`.
    This is a bit questionable, but hopefully it won't be too much of
    a problem.
