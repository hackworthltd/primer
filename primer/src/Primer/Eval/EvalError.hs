-- | Errors that can be raised during reduction.
--
-- Note: none of these should occur in normal operation.
-- If we get an EvalError, it means either:
-- - we provided bad input, e.g. an ID not in the given expression
-- - the typechecker has a bug which has allowed a badly-typed expression
-- - a previous invocation of 'step' created a badly-typed expression
--
-- The last case is most likely, since we currently don't typecheck the results of evaluation.
-- We should keep an eye on this to see if there are any issues.
