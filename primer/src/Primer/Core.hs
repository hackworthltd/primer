-- Note [Holes and bidirectionality]
--
-- A @EmptyHole@ (often denoted @?@) is similar to the notion of a
-- typed hole from Haskell or goal from Agda: these are parts of the
-- program that have not yet been filled in. They are allowed to have
-- any type (technically they have type @TEmptyHole@, which is
-- analogous to the "dynamic" type from gradual typing).
--
-- @Hole@s (often denoted @{? e ?}@, where the @e@ is the inner
-- expression), aka "non-empty holes" are similar, but they wrap
-- another @Expr@: this is a "typing mismatch". They allow (similarly
-- to Agda's goals) step-by-step building up a complex term that will
-- eventually get inserted into that position in the program, without
-- forcing it to be well-typed at every intermediate step. This is
-- also similar to the idea of "blame" from the blame calculus.
--
-- From the "outside", both sorts of holes behave the same:
-- intuitively, they behave as if they had any type whatsoever.
-- (Indeed, they can seem to have multiple types simultaneously:
-- @let x = ? in x && (x > 2)@ is well-typed, although there is no
-- concrete term that can fill in the hole). This is achieved by them
-- being synthesisable (and thus can appear in any context: it is not
-- required for the context to say what type is expected), and they
-- synthesise the type @TEmptyHole@ which is consistent with (roughly,
-- silently coercible with) any type.
--
-- From the "inside" of a non-empty hole, there is a choice to be made
-- about typing. How does one typecheck @{? e ?}@ since we have no
-- information about what type @e@ should have?
-- The choice our system makes is to require @e@ to check against a type
-- hole. Note that since we do not require @e@ to synthesise a type, it
-- is possible to put a lambda directly inside a hole: @{? λx. x ?}@ is
-- well-typed.
-- The other possible choice is to require the wrapped expression to be
-- synthesisable (and ignore which particular type it synthesises).
-- This second choice was taken by Hazel. This has the drawback of being
-- slightly more restrictive, since one cannot put a lambda directly
-- inside a hole, but would have to annotate it (with a hole):
-- @{? λx.x : ? ?}@. (Note that this is generally applicable, so the
-- restriction is mild.) However, it has the advantage of it being easier to
-- tell whether a hole can be elided, i.e. in a checkable context with a
-- synthesisable term in the hole, e.g. @Succ {? not True ?}@ or
-- @Succ {? plus 2 2 ?}@ one only needs to check type equality between the
-- context and the expression-inside-the-hole, whereas if there is a checkable
-- term in the hole one would need to actually do the typechecking. Since our
-- system just attempts to remove the hole and sees what happens (perhaps
-- wrapping some subterm in a hole, like in @{? Just True ?} : Maybe Int@
-- producing @Just {? True ?} : Maybe Int@), this is not actually a drawback
-- in practice.
-- The reason we made this choice is because the restriction, whilst being mild
-- in theory is pretty annoying in practice, for a human using this system. It
-- also slightly simplifies some cases in the implementation, since we sometimes
-- (some actions, smartholes etc) need to do an edit and then wrap some
-- previously (but no longer) well-typed subexpression in a hole, and with this
-- choice we do not need to worry about directionality.

-- Note [Checkable constructors]
--
-- Our calculus is heavily inspired by bidirectional type systems
-- (especially McBride's principled rendition). In particular we treat
-- constructors very differently to functions.
--
-- We represent a constructor-applied-to-a-spine as a thing (and can
-- only check its type), where we insist that it is fully saturated.
-- Thus whilst `Cons` is a term, it is ill-typed. The only well-formed
-- `Cons` usages are `Cons x xs`, which checks against `List A`
-- when `A ∋ x` and `List A ∋ xs`.
-- (Note that there are no type arguments here!)
--
-- Whilst this may be a bit inconsistent with the treatment of
-- functions, it has the advantage of symmetry with construction and
-- matching. (I.e. every time one sees a particular constructor, it
-- has the same form: a head of that constructor, and the same number
-- of (term) fields.)
--
-- As an example, `List Int ∋ Cons 2 Nil`, but `Cons` and `Cons 2` are ill-typed.
-- Thus one needs to be aware of the difference between, say,
-- a globally-defined function, and a constructor "of the same type".
-- For example, one can partially apply an addition function and map it
-- across a list: `map (1 +) [2,3]` is well-typed, but one cannot map
-- the `Succ` constructor in the same way, or partially-apply the `Cons` constructor.
-- (Notice, however, that since one will always know what type one is
-- considering, the constructor does not need any type applications
-- corresponding to the parameters of its datatype.)
-- Clearly one could eta-expand, (and if necessary add an annotation) to
-- use as constructor non-saturatedly: e.g. write `map (λn . Succ n) [2,3]`.

-- Note [Case]
-- We use a list for compatibility and ease of JSON
-- serialization/deserialization.
-- It would potentially be worth moving to some other structure here.
--
-- INVARIANT: branches are sorted in order of constructor in data declaration
-- We may wish to relax this decision later.
-- This is enforced in the typechecker. The purpose of this invariant is
-- twofold: having a canonical/normalised AST and making the typechecker a bit
-- simpler as we don't have to worry about looking up constructors and whether
-- we have got exactly one branch per constructor.
